In certain scenarios, applications may opt not to utilize foreign keys, especially when dealing with intricate data transfer between services.
The challenge arises during data import, where maintaining the correct order becomes crucial if "foreign keys" are enabled. To address this, developers might choose to temporarily disable "foreign keys" using migrations.

However, this approach entails writing migrations for each table and removing all existing "foreign keys," which can prove to be a cumbersome process. This flexibility provided by migrations allows developers to manage situations where the enforcement of "foreign keys" needs to be temporarily lifted for seamless data loading and subsequent reimplementation of constraints.

### Implementation in Rails 7.1

In Rails 7.1, a new option in database.yml enables the skipping of foreign key constraints, eliminating the need for extensive migrations to disable foreign keys for all tables. This enhancement streamlines database management, providing a more efficient solution for developers

```ruby
development:
  <<: *default
  database: db/development.sqlite3
  foreign_keys: false
```

### Conclusion

Rails 7.1's 'Adapter' Option empowers developers with fine-grained control over foreign keys. Dive in and discover how it can elevate your Rails development. Stay updated for more features and enhancements in the dynamic world of Ruby on Rails.
