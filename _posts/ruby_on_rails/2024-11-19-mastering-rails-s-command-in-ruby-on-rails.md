## # Mastering the rails s Command in Ruby on Rails
The `rails s` (short for rails server) command is your gateway to running a local web server for Ruby on Rails applications. With just a single command, you can start developing and testing your app locally.

#### How to Use the `rails s` Command

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your Rails project folder.
2. Run the following command:
```ruby
rails s  
```
3. By default, the server runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Options You Can Use

Specify a Port: Use rails s -p 4000 to run the server on port 4000.
Choose a Server: Use rails s -u puma to specify a server type (e.g., Puma or WEBrick).
Set the Environment: Run rails s -e production to start the server in production mode.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If the server doesn't start, check for port conflicts or missing dependencies.
- Restart the server after making changes to `config` files.


The `rails s` command is an essential tool for any Rails developer. Mastering its options and troubleshooting techniques ensures smooth app development!
