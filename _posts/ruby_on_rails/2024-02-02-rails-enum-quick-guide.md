### Unveiling Enums in Rails

Enums provide a concise method to assign symbolic names to integer values, simplifying the representation of attributes with a limited set of options.

<br/>

### Quick Implementation Steps
- Declare Enums in Your Model:

```ruby
# Define an enum in your Rails model to specify the attribute and its possible values.
class Task < ApplicationRecord
  enum status: [:pending, :in_progress, :completed]
end
```

- Tap into Enum Methods:
  Enjoy the convenience of Enum methods like `Task.statuses`` or `Task.pending`` for seamless querying.

- Database Magic
Behind the scenes, Enums optimize storage by storing values as integers in the database.

### Advantages of Embracing Enums

- ### Enhanced Readability:
Replace integers with meaningful symbols for clearer, more readable code.

- ### Streamlined Maintainability:
Centralize management of attribute options as your application evolves.

- ### Built-in Validation:
Enums provide automatic validation, ensuring only valid values are assigned.


<br/>

## Quick Best Practices

- ### Perfect for Small, Fixed Sets:
  Use Enums for attributes with a well-defined, limited set of options.

- ### Descriptive Naming:
  Opt for clear and descriptive Enum names to boost code readability.

- ### Leverage Scopes:
  Utilize built-in scopes for easy querying based on attribute values.
