Have you ever found yourself in a situation where the default methods generated by ActiveRecord Enums felt a bit too much? Rails 7.1 has your back with a handy new option - `instance_methods: false`. Let's take a minute to understand how this feature can offer you more control over your Rails models.


## ActiveRecord Enums in a Nutshell

These attributes map values to integers in the database, generating handy methods for easy querying and manipulation. By the way, as of Rails 7 the syntax of defining has changed. <base target="_blank">[Rails-7 New Syntax For Enum](/rails/2024/02/04/rails-7-enum-syntax.html)


## The Scenario Before

Imagine a User model with a role enum:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  enum :role, { admin: 0, moderator: 1, regular: 2 }
end
```
Default methods like `user.admin?` made working with enums a breeze.

## Rails 7.1 Unveils Control

Now, with Rails 7.1, the instance_methods: false option allows you to disable auto-generated methods:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  enum :role, { admin: 0, moderator: 1, regular: 2 }, instance_methods: false
end
```

## The Impact
The change is evident when querying and manipulating enum values:

```ruby
user = User.first
user.role # => admin
user.admin? # => `method_missing': undefined method `admin?' 
user.regular! # => `method_missing': undefined method `regular!'
```

## Why Opt for instance_methods: false?
When default methods lead to conflicts or are unnecessary, this option helps avoid generating unwanted enum methods, keeping your code clean and conflict-free.

## In a Nutshell

In a minute, you've learned about the `instance_methods: false` option in Rails 7.1. Tailor your code, avoid unnecessary methods, and take control of your ActiveRecord Enums. Embrace the flexibility and control Rails 7.1 brings to enhance your Rails development journey!
