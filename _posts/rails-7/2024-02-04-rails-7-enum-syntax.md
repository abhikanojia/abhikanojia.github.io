Welcome to the Future of Rails Enums in Version 7!

Rails 7 introduces a breath of fresh air with revamped Enum syntax, promising a cleaner and more intuitive coding experience.

# Old vs. New: A Quick Look

In the old days, defining Enums involved a key-value pair jumble, but not anymore! Rails 7 separates enum names and values, making your code more straightforward:

```ruby
# Before
enum status: [ :draft, :published, :archived ], _prefix: true, _scopes: false

# After
enum :status, [ :draft, :published, :archived ], prefix: true, scopes: false

```

## Hash Syntax Delight

But that's not all! The changes seamlessly extend to hash syntax, giving you even more flexibility:

```ruby
# Hash syntax
enum :status, { draft: 0, published: 1, archived: 2 }, prefix: true, scopes: false

```

## But why bother the switch?

Based on this [PR#41328](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/41328) discussion and is quoted:
>
> That is due to enum takes one hash argument only, which contains both
> enum definitions and reserved options.
> I propose new syntax for enum to avoid leading _ from reserved
> options, by allowing enum(attr_name, ..., **options) more Attribute
> API like syntax.

So it was to avoid `_` in reserved options for enum definition.

## Does it mean the older enum is deprecated?

It is not yet deprecated, which means the older syntax is still valid as of Rails 7.1.3

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  enum status: [:draft, :published]
end
```
<br/>

<mark>** Please note that the new `enum` validation options as mentioned in the</mark> [Article](/rails/2024/02/03/rails-7.1-enum-validation.html) <mark>will result in error if you try to use it with old syntax.</mark>

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  enum status: [:draft, :published], validate: true
end

post = Post.new
#
# => `raise_conflict_error`: You tried to define an enum named "status" on the model "Post", but this will generate a instance method "draft?", which is already defined by another enum. (ArgumentError)
```
