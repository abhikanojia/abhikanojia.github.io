With the release of Rails 7.1, a notable enhancement has been introduced in the realm of enum handling - the all-new :validate option. This addition is designed to offer developers a heightened level of flexibility and robustness when it comes to validating enum values within their ActiveRecord models.

## Before the Era of Rails 7.1

In preceding versions of Rails, attempting to assign an incorrect value to an enum would trigger the infamous ArgumentError. Let's examine an example:

```ruby
class Holiday < ApplicationRecord
  enum type: [:national, :regional]
end

holiday = Holiday.last
holiday.type = :optional
# Output: 'optional' is not a valid type (ArgumentError)
```

The above snippet illustrates that assigning 'optional' as the type leads to an `ArgumentError`, signaling that 'optional' is not a valid value for the enum.

## The Arrival of Rails 7.1's Validate Option

Rails 7.1 ushers in the validate option, allowing developers to explicitly enforce validation checks before persisting enum values. Let's observe the impact of this enhancement:

```ruby
class Holiday < ApplicationRecord
  enum type: [:national, :regional], validate: true
end

holiday = Holiday.last

holiday.type = :optional
holiday.valid? # Output: false

holiday.type = nil
holiday.valid? # Output: false

holiday.type = :national
holiday.valid? # Output: true

```

By incorporating validate: true, Rails 7.1 enables developers to validate enum values explicitly. Now, any attempt to set an invalid value will result in a false output when checking for validity.

## Additional Validation Possibilities

To further enhance validation options, developers can include additional parameters:

```ruby
class Holiday < ApplicationRecord
  enum type: [:national, :regional], validate: { allow_nil: true }
end

holiday = Holiday.last

holiday.type = :optional
holiday.valid? # Output: false

holiday.type = nil
holiday.valid? # Output: true

```

<br/>

In this scenario, the inclusion of `allow_nil: true` provides greater flexibility, enabling developers to set enum values as nil while still maintaining overall validation.

** It's essential to note that if the validate option is omitted, Rails will revert to its previous behavior, raising an ArgumentError for invalid enum values.
